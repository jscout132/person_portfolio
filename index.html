                For some reason, portfolio websites are always the hardest for me. They're also usually an early ask of 
                web design students. I've made at least three of these in the past and every time,
                the page stays blank far longer than it needs to. Picking a color scheme, let alone a font, that encapsulates me is a struggle.
                I have done some web design work in the past. 
                In the years since college, I've been working in a few different corners of the non-profit world, 
                mostly doing fundraising and grant writing.

                I have always drawn to the more technical aspects of my past jobs and was typically the unofficial tech person,
                taking on tasking including but not limited to fixing the printer, mail merging about 3,200 envelopes, or installing 
                new programs. After about 7 years of that, I decided it was time to actually explore those interests further, 
                which lead me to back programming and coding.

        I live in Durham, North Carolina with my wife, two cats, Freya and Tonks, and dog, Mona. In my free time
        I enjoy going on walks, birdwatching, rock climbing, drawing, playing video games, and reading. I'm 
        pretty much always working on too many projects and never finishing them. Same with books, though a 
        higher finish rate there.
